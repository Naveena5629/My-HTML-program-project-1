    <p><b>A Rose is the National emblem of England</b>.<i> Roses are known as the "King of Flowers"</i> and come in many colors, including red, white, pink, yellow, peach, cream, orange, and maroon. They can vary in size, from as small as 1/2 inch across to almost 7 inches in diameter. Rose plants have prickly stems and glossy, green leaves with toothed edges. Rose is one of the most beautiful flowers among several others. Roses are often grown for their ornamental flowers in gardens and sometimes indoors. They can also be used for commercial perfumery, cut flower crops, hedging, game cover, and slope stabilization. Rose petals are often used in perfumes, rose water, and rose essence. Garlands of roses are often used in places of worship and for wedding decorations.</p>
